# BalanceaGo - Find Your Balance

BalanceaGo is a mobile application that helps students find a balance between their studies and social life. With the increasing demands of academic life, students often struggle to find time for other aspects of their lives. BalanceaGo is the solution to this problem - it provides students with a platform to manage their schedules effectively and prioritize their time.

## Contribution
As part of the BalanceaGo project, I contributed to the structuring of the idea and the development of the front-end of the mobile application using React Native. React Native is a popular JavaScript framework that enables the development of native mobile applications for iOS and Android platforms.

## Features
The BalanceaGo application offers the following features to help students find balance in their lives:

- Customizable schedules: Students can create their schedules and set priorities for their tasks.
- Real-time notifications: Students receive notifications for upcoming tasks and events.
- Time management: Students can track their time spent on tasks and optimize their schedules.
- Social integration: Students can connect with other students and make plans together.

## Technology
BalanceaGo was built using React Native for the front-end development, and Firebase was used for the backend. Firebase provides a serverless backend solution that allows for real-time data synchronization and storage.
